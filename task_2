Equal Department Importance, Similar Threats: Tests a scenario where all departments have similar mean threat scores, equal users, and equal importance. 
This checks if the aggregation function correctly averages similar inputs.

Different Importance Levels: Tests the functionâ€™s sensitivity to department importance, especially where high importance departments (e.g., Engineering) have higher mean threat scores.

High Outliers in One Department: Validates how the function handles a single department with very high threat scores (e.g., potential targeted risk) while others are low. 
This ensures outliers influence the score correctly based on department importance.

Minimal Threats in All Departments: Ensures that if all departments have minimal threat levels, the aggregate threat score reflects low risk, even when department importances vary.
